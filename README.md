Event Spotter is an Android application that allows users to discover events happening around their current or desired location. It integrates Google Maps for visual location tracking and uses charts for data-driven insights into event distribution.

Google Maps Integration:
Visualize nearby events on an interactive map based on the user's current location or any chosen location.

Search by Location:
Search for events in a specific area by entering the desired location.

Event Visualization with Bar Chart:
View a bar chart showing the number of events in different nearby areas using MPAndroidChart.

Real-Time Updates:
Event data is dynamically fetched via a custom-built EventSpotter API and optionally synced using Firebase.
